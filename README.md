## 🌟 Overview

Healthcare devices are increasingly connected to the internet, creating unprecedented opportunities for patient care—but also new vulnerabilities. Our Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System addresses this critical challenge by enabling IoHT devices to collaboratively learn from cyberattacks without ever sharing sensitive patient data.
